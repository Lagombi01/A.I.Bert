Understanding login.js 

Here's a summary of what's happening in your code:

You're getting both the login and sign-up forms from the DOM using the document.getElementById method and storing the references to these forms in the loginForm and signupForm variables, respectively.

You're attaching a submit event listener to the login form using loginForm.addEventListener. When the form is submitted, you prevent the default form submit behavior using event.preventDefault() and retrieve the form data using the FormData object.

You then extract the values of the username and password fields from the form data and use them to make a POST request to the /api/auth/login endpoint with the fetch method. The request body is the JSON string containing the username and password. You set the Content-Type header to "application/json".

You then check the response status code. If the status code is 401, you throw an error with the message "Invalid username or password". If the status code is not in the 200-299 range, you throw an error with the message "Network response was not ok".

If the response was successful, you log the result to the console and show an alert indicating a successful login.

If any errors occur during the fetch operation or in any of the previous then blocks, you catch the error and log it to the console.

The process for the sign-up form is similar, but with a few additional steps:

You also extract the values of the email and confirm_password fields from the form data.
You check if the password and confirmPassword fields match. If they don't, you show an alert and return from the event handler.
You make a POST request to the /api/auth/signup endpoint with the same process as the login request.
You handle the response and errors in the same way as for the login request.
Your code should work as expected, but you should also test it thoroughly to make sure it behaves as you want it to.
